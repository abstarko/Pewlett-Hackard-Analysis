# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

A companys asks to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

## Overview of the Analysis

Using SQL we analyze the data using two categories, one being Number of Retiring Employees by their title and the other being Employees that are eligible for the mentorship program that is being offered. 
## Results

Looking at our results we can see that:
- There are two managers that are eligible to retire at the company, which could be issue with there only being so few managers at the company.
- The top two job titles that have potential retirment are Senior Staff and Senior Engineer. 
- For mentorship eligibility we were able to see that both Senior Staff and Engineers had the most employees eligible in the 500's.
- In total 72,458 employees could possibly retire and 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. 

## Summary 

We can now see that there are 7 roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins in order to make an impact, these include the following - Senior Engineer, Senior Staff, Engineer, Staff, Technique Leader, Assistant Engineer, and Manager.

We can see that the number of employees who potentially are able to mentor is much less than the number of employees that may retire. That tells us that most likely there will be enough qualified retirements ready employees to mentor the next generation.

We could expand our data by pulling each department and comparing the retirement to the mentorship numbers to see if there will be enough employees to be mentors for their specific department. We could also dive deeper into the age range and break it out from there.
